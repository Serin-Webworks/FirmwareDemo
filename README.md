# Serin Firmware Demo

## What This Is
This is a safe, demo-only firmware repository for **SerinTech Vault**. It mimics a real firmware release pipeline but **does not** target any real device. The output is a deterministic, firmware-like binary with a simple header and payload.

## Download
Releases are published on GitHub Releases. Download the latest assets from the Releases page and verify the checksum.

## Build Locally
Requirements:
- macOS or Linux: `make`, `cc`
- Windows: Use MSYS2 (MINGW64) with `make` and `gcc` installed

Build:
```bash
make release
```

## Output Files Explained
The `dist/` folder is generated by `make release`.

- `serin-firmware-demo-vX.Y.Z.bin`
  - A demo firmware-like binary that includes a header and a deterministic payload.
- `manifest.json`
  - Build metadata (version, timestamp, commit hash, file size, SHA-256).
- `checksums.txt`
  - SHA-256 checksum for the `.bin` file.

## Version Lifecycle
This project demonstrates archived releases.

## Security Note
Not for real devices.
